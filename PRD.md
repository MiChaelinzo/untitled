## Edge Case Handling

- **Accidental taps**: Outside-target clicks don't penalize but don't grant points either, preventing frustration
- **Network issues**: Scores save locally first via KV storage, no network required for full functionality
- **Duplicate names**: Append timestamp suffix to leaderboard entries with identical names
- **Mid-game exit**: ESC key brings up quit confirmation, progress saved if player quits early
- **Leaderboard spam**: Rate limit submissions to 1 per minute per device (client-side)
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Touch targets automatically scale to minimum 44px regardless of screen size, enhanced touch feedback
- **Audio context limitations**: Web Audio API auto-initializes on user interaction (browser requirement), sound preference and theme selection persist between sessions via KV storage
- **Difficulty persistence**: Selected difficulty persists between sessions for consistent player experience
- **Mixed difficulty leaderboard**: All difficulty levels share one leaderboard with difficulty badges for context and fairness
- **Practice mode scores**: Clearly marked, don't affect leaderboard to prevent sandbagging
- **Achievement unlocks**: Queued and displayed one at a time to avoid overwhelming UI
- **Challenge refresh timing**: Challenges auto-refresh at predetermined times (daily: midnight, weekly: Monday), with client-side checks on app load
- **Expired badges**: Time-limited badges automatically removed from player inventory after expiry, with clear expiration countdown displayed
- **Challenge progress in practice mode**: Practice mode games don't count toward challenge progress to prevent farming
- **Multiple challenge completion**: Single game can complete multiple challenges simultaneously, all rewards claimable independently
- **XP and level calculations**: Level progression uses quadratic formula for balanced scaling, level-up feedback provided via toast notifications
- **Title equipping**: Players can unlock multiple titles but only equip one at a time, selection persists across sessions
- **Challenge reward claiming**: Rewards must be manually claimed in Challenges tab, preventing accidental XP/badge acquisition, share button appears after claiming
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Space for quick restart on game over, ESC for quit confirmation during gameplay
- **Stats persistence**: All player statistics stored in KV and survive page refreshes, device changes
- **Social sharing window blocking**: If popup blockers prevent Twitter window, gracefully fallback to copy-to-clipboard with instructional toast
- **Share text personalization**: Share messages include player name when available, fallback to "I" for anonymous shares
- **Badge expiration and sharing**: Expired badges are removed from inventory but historical shares remain valid, creating scarcity-driven urgency
- **Friend system offline mode**: All friend data stored locally via KV storage, no server required for full functionality
- **Challenge expiration**: Challenges automatically expire after 24 hours, removed from active list but preserved in history
- **Duplicate challenge prevention**: Cannot send multiple active challenges to same friend, must wait for completion or expiration
- **Challenge score validation**: Both players must complete challenge on same difficulty, scores verified against difficulty multipliers
- **Friend search mock data**: Demo implementation uses mock player profiles for search functionality, easily extensible to real backend
- **Win/loss statistics**: Tracks total wins, losses, and current win streak for competitive leaderboard integration
- **Challenge notification badges**: Visual indicators on Friends tab show pending friend requests and incoming challenges

## Design Direction

The design should feel like stepping into a cyberpunk training facility meets esports arena - electric, high-energy, and unmistakably Cloud9. Think neon lights cutting through darkness, aggressive geometric shapes, glitch effects on transitions, and the kind of UI that makes you feel like a competitor the moment you tap in. Every interaction should pulse with intensity.

## Color Selection

A dark, high-contrast cyberpunk palette with electrifying accents that pop against near-black backgrounds.

- **Primary Color**: Cloud9 Electric Blue (oklch(0.65 0.24 240)) - The signature C9 brand color representing trust, precision, and competitive excellence
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Deep Space Navy (oklch(0.15 0.02 240)) - Main background creating dramatic contrast
  - Neon Cyan (oklch(0.75 0.18 195)) - Active states and highlights
- **Accent Color**: Plasma Pink (oklch(0.70 0.25 350)) - CTAs, hit effects, and combo multipliers demanding immediate attention
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Deep Space Navy (oklch(0.15 0.02 240)): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Electric Blue (oklch(0.65 0.24 240)): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 5.8:1 ✓
  - Plasma Pink (oklch(0.70 0.25 350)): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 6.1:1 ✓
  - Neon Cyan (oklch(0.75 0.18 195)): Deep Navy (oklch(0.15 0.02 240)) - Ratio 8.5:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should scream competitive gaming - bold, geometric, technical, and unmistakably modern.

- **Primary**: Orbitron (Google Fonts) - A futuristic geometric sans-serif that embodies the technical precision of esports
- **Secondary**: Rajdhani (Google Fonts) - A sharp, condensed typeface for UI elements and rapid information display

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Game Title): Orbitron Bold/48px/tight letter-spacing (2px)
  - H2 (Round Announcements): Orbitron SemiBold/36px/normal
  - H3 (Scores): Orbitron Medium/28px/wide letter-spacing (3px)
  - Body (Instructions): Rajdhani Medium/18px/normal line-height (1.5)
  - UI Labels: Rajdhani Bold/14px/uppercase/wide tracking
  - Leaderboard Entries: Rajdhani SemiBold/16px/tabular numbers

## Animations

Animations should create moments of explosive feedback and cyberpunk flair without slowing down the fast-paced gameplay.

**Gameplay Animations**:
- Target spawn: Scale from 0 with electric glow pulse (200ms cubic-bezier)
- Target hit: Explosive particle burst radiating outward with screen shake and satisfying audio pop
- Miss penalty: Red flash with subtle recoil animation and low descending tone
- Combo multiplier: Numbers scale up with electric arc effects and ascending note sequence

**UI Animations**:
- Button hover: Lift with neon underglow intensifying
- Screen transitions: Glitch wipe effect with RGB split and musical transition
- Score counting: Rapid numeric increment with electric crackle sound
- Leaderboard updates: Slide in from right with highlight pulse

**Audio Design**:
- Three distinct sound themes available via dropdown selector:
  - **Sci-Fi** (default): Synthesized high-frequency sine waves with noise bursts and filtered modulations - futuristic and spacey
  - **Retro Arcade**: Classic square and triangle wave chiptune sounds - nostalgic 8-bit gaming aesthetic
  - **Minimal**: Pure sine wave tones - clean and subtle for focus-oriented players
- Hit sounds: Pitch increases with combo level across all themes
- Miss sounds: Descending tones with theme-appropriate wave shapes
- Combo sounds: Theme-specific celebratory sequences
- Round start: Ascending fanfares with theme variation
- Game over: Descending sequences with theme-appropriate synthesis
- Sound preference and theme selection persist between sessions

Balance: Explosive moments on hits/scores create dopamine spikes with both visual and audio feedback, while UI animations are swift and purposeful to maintain pace.
